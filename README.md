Goal: to develop a medium for students at partnered high schools to source the skills of their student community––lowering the financial and social limitations of actualizing their projects––and encouraging the development of their skills and interests. Projects are to be validated by the students’ respective schools upon completion. User profiles serve as a ‘receipt’ of their work ethic, passion, and time-commitment (and hopefully can be represented as such in the college process).
